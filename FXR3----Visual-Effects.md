The primary way to edit FXR3's is to use [NamelessHoodie's Dantelion FXR3 Editor](https://www.nexusmods.com/darksouls3/mods/1075)

Another less common way to edit FXR3 is to use [FXR3-XMLR](https://github.com/NamelessHoodie/FXR3-XMLR-Hoodieforked/releases/latest) to deserialize them, then XML edit them.
